Description: TemaZero is a clean and creative blog theme for writers and bloggers. The theme is responsive, it is fully compatible with mobile phones, desktop computers and tablets such as iPads. The WordPress theme has a full width multi purpose design which is minimal and simple. The readability is optimized through great typography. You can use it as a newspaper or magazine where you post your news about your personal life, food, entertainment, gaming or anything else. Page builders work fine with the theme, and since it's full width by default you can create a landing page or one page easily to visualize your business, agency or consultant company.
